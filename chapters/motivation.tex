\chapter*{Motivation} 
Two main factors amounted the motivation for this study. 

One of the motivations for this study was to contribute with a small improvement towards increased physical activity amongst norwegians. It is shocking that only 30 percent actually fulfill the minimal recommendations from Helsedirektoratet and FHI. That means that 70 percent of norwegian citizens have a greater risk of dying early or becoming ill with non-communicable diseases. The tools to reduce those numbers lays within HCI sphere of technology. By performing active nudging through digital environments a higher training frequency may be envisioned. 

Another motivation for this study was to check if there is any merit in aligning goals and sharing information across boundaries of commercial players and national health authorities. On the grand scale it seems that they have converging interests and goals. By exploiting  each other's knowledge and cooperate accordingly, they may be able to strengthen their own role and purpose. 

An additional motivational factor has been to experience how research can be applied to real world context.
