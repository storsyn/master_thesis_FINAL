\section{Additional investigations triggered by Covid-19}

%Future work eller discussion? HVOR SKAL DETTE 
Even though this way of nudging (informational health nudges) immediately invites the reflective mind, it would be interesting to see how such intervention would lead to over time.  For future work, it would also be interesting to look at different types and ways of implementation. In particular looking at those who talks to the automatic mind.

\subsection{Changes and adjustments in regards of Covid-19 }

\subsection{Sample selection / Variations across participants}
Due to time constrictions, corona and ethics of doing research we used convenience sampling. As we imposed convenience sampling for this study, the 

Among those who signed up as participants in the study, the selection was representative. But due to the time constrictions (lost time due to corona) we had to make interviews with the ones available first. We did not have time to sort of age and gender, even though we had the opportunity for it in regards of number of participants and the variation in age and gender.

The intention to include training members was that among this group / selection of people there will always be someone who trains a lot and someone that does not, meaning / in other words; it was representative for a large part of Norway's population. However, all members of training center share / has one ting in common; the motivation / intention to engage in some form of physical activity, because they already became a member (invest money in their own health). When we consider Fogg's behaviour model, we see that motivation is one of three fundamental elements that needs to be in place for a behaviour to occur. Ability and prompts are the other two.
